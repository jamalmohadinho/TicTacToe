# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe

Hey! 👋 This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game I built using **React**. It’s the classic Xs and Os game where two players take turns trying to get three in a row.

I built this project mainly to practice core React skills like **useState**, passing **props**, and handling **click events** between components. The game keeps track of turns, detects the winner, and lets you restart anytime.
